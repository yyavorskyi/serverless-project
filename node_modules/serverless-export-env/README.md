## About

This Serverless plugin exports the environment variables defined in `serverless.yml` into a distinct `.env` file. This allows you to access these environment variables from local scripts such as for integration tests. You will find the `.env` file
in the root folder of your project.

It will collect the global environment variables of the poject as well as all environment variables of the functions. It will also add `API_ENDPOINT` and `IS_OFFLINE` to your environment if you run the plugin via `serverless offline`.

Environment variables referencing CloudFormation resources (e.g. `Ref: MyDynamoDbTable`), or import values (e.g. `Fn::ImportValue: MyExportedValue`) are automatically resolved to their respective values. This, however, requires the stack to be
deployed before the plugin can access any of these variables.

This plugin is based on the [serverless-dotenv Plugin by Jimdo](https://github.com/Jimdo/serverless-dotenv) but largely rewritten to fit our needs.

## Why another plugin?

There're plenty of environment and dotenv plugins available for Serverless. However, some are already obsolete, others are very limited in use case. We needed a possibility to access Serverless environment variables from command line during integration testing of our code. As some of these environment variables are referencing CloudFormation resources, none of the existing plugins was able to solve this.

## Referencing CloudFormation resources

Serverless offers a very powerful feature: You are able to reference AWS resources anywhere from within your `.yaml` and it will automatically resolve them to their respective values during deployment. A common example is to bind a DynamoDB table name to an environment variable, so you can access it in your Lambda function implementation later:

```yaml
provider:
  environment:
    TABLE_NAME:
      Ref: MyDynamoDbTable
# ...
resources:
  Resources:
    MyDynamoDbTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      DeletionPolicy: Retain
      Properties:
        # ...
```

Later in your code you can simply access `process.env.TABLE_NAME` to get the proper DynamoDB table name without having to hardcode anything.

```js
require("dotenv").config({
  path: "../.env" /* path to your project root folder */,
});

const AWS = require("aws-sdk");
const docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({
  /* ... */
});
docClient.get(
  {
    TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
    Key: { foo: "bar" },
  },
  (result) => {
    console.log(result);
  }
);
```

The _Serverless Export Env Plugin_ supports references to resources created within the `serverless.yml`, to resources imported from another stack via `Fn::ImportValue`, pseudo parameters such as `AWS::Region` and `AWS::AccountId` as well as the commonly used `Fn::Join` intrinsic function.

The plugin allows you to make use of these references (and all other environment variables of course) from the command line by
exporting them into a `.env` file in your project folder. Then use a library such as [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to read them during runtime.

## Usage

Add the npm package to your project:

```sh
# Via yarn
$ yarn add arabold/serverless-export-env --dev

# Via npm
$ npm install arabold/serverless-export-env --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-export-env
```

That's it! You can now call `serverless export-env` in your terminal to generate the `.env` file based on your Serverless configuration. Alternative you can just start `serverless invoke local -f FUNCTION` or `serverless offline` to generate it.

### Change filename and path

You can change the path and file name of the `.env` file by adding the following options to your `serverless.yml`:

```yml
export-env:
  pathFromRoot: "dist/app"
  filename: aws.env
```

## Provided lifecycle events

- `export-env:collect` - Collect environment variables from Serverless
- `export-env:resolve` - Resolve CloudFormation references and import variables
- `export-env:apply` - Set environment variables when testing Lambda functions locally
- `export-env:write` - Write environment variables to file

## Example

```sh
serverless export-env
```

This example will export all environment variables into a `.env` file in your project root folder.

## Releases

### 1.4.3

- Reverted changes in 1.4.1. Unfortunately we broke the semver contract by introducing a breaking feature in a patch update. This feature needs to be rethought and added back in a 1.5.x release as optional. Until then, I had to remove it again.

### 1.4.2

- Fixed some compatibility issues with the latest Serverless framework release. Thanks to [pgrzesik](https://github.com/pgrzesik) for the necessary updates.

### 1.4.1

- Disabled calls to the real aws infrastructure when running with Serverless Offline. Thanks to marooned071 for the contribution.

### 1.4.0

- Collect and set resource values from actual Cloud Formation stack output. Thanks to [andersquist](https://github.com/andersquist) for his contribution!
- Fix error when serverless.yml doesn't contain a custom section. Thanks to [michael-wolfenden](https://github.com/michael-wolfenden)!

### 1.3.1

- Explicitly set environment variables during local invocation of the Lambda (`sls invoke local`)

### 1.3.0

- Support different output file name and path. Thanks to [philiiiiiipp](https://github.com/philiiiiiipp).
- Export `Outputs` as environment variables. Thanks to [lielran](https://github.com/lielran).
- Updated to latest dependencies

### 1.2.0

- Use operating system-specific end-of-line when creating `.env` file

### 1.1.3

- Fixed an issue with `AWS::AccountId` being resolved as `[Object Promise]` instead of the actual value.

### 1.1.2

- Fixed an issue with CloudFormation resources not being resolved properly if the stack has more than 100 resources or exports.

### 1.1.1

- Fix issue with multiple environment variables for function (thanks to [@Nevon](https://github.com/Nevon)).

### 1.1.0

- Support `Fn::Join` operation (contribution by [@jonasho](https://github.com/jonasho))
- Support pseudo parameters `AWS::Region`, `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::StackId` and `AWS::StackName`.

### 1.0.2

- The plugin now properly resolves and sets the environment variables if a Lambda function is invoked locally (`serverless invoke local -f FUNCTION`). This allows seamless as if the function would be deployed on AWS.

### 1.0.1

- Corrected plugin naming
- Improved documentation

### 1.0.0

- This is the initial release with all basic functionality

### To-Dos

- [ ] Add support for more intrinsic functions such as `Fn::GetAtt`, `Fn::Sub`,
      etc. (see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.html)
- [ ] Write some tests!
